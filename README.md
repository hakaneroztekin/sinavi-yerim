# What is SÄ±navÄ±-Yerim
* SÄ±navÄ±-Yerim is a blog that I've founded to help high school students with their exams and career choices. Also to guide university students and graduates.

* Published **200+ articles**, visited **2.5 million** times.

# What about the Technologies?
* Until the mid 2019, I was sharing articles weekly through email. I was not pleased with overall user experience and decided to develop a modern and minimalistic (thanks Medium!) page. 

* I was not very experienced with all the technologies at first but learned to use them along the way.

* At the new [blog](https://blog.sinaviyerim.com) page: It's one page **React** application. It connects to API developed with **Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring MVC** which is **deployed to AWS EBS**, and **PostgreSQL deployed to AWS RDS**. To provide faster UX, **AWS Cloudfront CDN** is integrated. For the upcoming membership feature, I'd need users to "Sign in Once" for multiple domains, **Auth0 Single Sign On** was the solution I've used.
 
# Backstory, Who am I?
* In Turkey, National University Entrance Exam takes place each year with 2 million participants. They take the exam to get into universities, preferably good ones.

* I was not coming from a good high school, in fact it was the least good one (don't want to say worst) at my surroundings. Regardless, I was aimed for Computer Engineering at one of the best universities. I was interested in computers since my 4'th degree at primary school.

* For my goal, I had to get into the **top 8.000 people among 2 million** students. I was failed with 50.000. I was persistent, took the risk and studied hard, more than ever. And achieved the **top 0.1% (2.7k-3.3k)**. 

* Right after people got very curious about my strategies. I was responding them with paragraphs but then thought why not publish my responses publicly and share them the link. That's the story of SÄ±navÄ±-Yerim. 

*Ever since, I continue helping people to achieve success through sharing articles.*
